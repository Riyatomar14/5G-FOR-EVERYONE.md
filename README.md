## 1 MODULE: wireless communications and cellular networks

# >wireless signal basic
first we will understand what factors ultimately impact the speed of the data rate that you get on your phone. Now, wireless communication allows transfer of information between a transmitter and a receiver without a physical medium. Emphasis on that clause, "without a physical medium." That is because many other forms of communications that we engage in on a daily basis require some or the other form of a medium. For example, a landline phone, if you have one at home, the signal for the landline phone comes over a wire, hence the name landline. Even our modern-day internet connection is actually delivered to your home using some form of an internet cable. Even when we speak with each other, our voice requires an explicit medium such as air or other solid medium to go from one point to another. In contrast to all of those examples, wireless communication does not need a physical medium. It can travel just as well in a vacuum space, so to speak. 

a typical wireless communication system has four fundamental components; A transmitter, a receiver, a wireless signal, and a fourth imaginary entity that is called a wireless channel.What is a transmitter?The entity that is looking to transmit some data to the other end over a wireless medium, that will be called the transmitter. On the other hand, the entity that is looking to receive that data will be called the receiver. In modern-day communication systems, most devices have the capability to act as both the transmitter as well as the receiver, either at the same time or at different points in time. As we all know, our antennas are also an integral part of any transmitter or receiver, because that is what helps you send or receive wireless signals. That brings us to the other two entities in a typical wireless system namely wireless signals are also called radio-frequency signals or RF Signals, and the imaginary channel over which those wireless signals go from one point to another called either the wireless channel or the radio channel. 

# >Radio Signal Properties, Carrier Waves and Modulation

all wireless signals travel at the speed of light, which is approximately 300,000 kilometers per second or about 186,000 miles per second and periodic in nature. In that, they show a certain pattern and that pattern repeats as a function of time. That fundamental periodic nature leads us to two basic attributes of radio frequency signals, namely frequency and wavelength.Frequency is the number of repetitions that the periodic electromagnetic signal undergoes in a given second, and the frequency is measured in the unit of hertz. Wavelength, on the other hand, is the distance that periodic wireless signal travels during one cycle or one periodicity, and because it is a measure of distance, it is mostly measured in meters or millimeters equivalently.If you multiply frequency and wavelength of a wireless radio signal, you get the speed of that radio signal, which as we know now is the universal constant, that is, the speed of light. Frequency and wavelength of a wireless signal are inversely related. The relational constant being the universal constant, the speed of light. The radio signals that are used for wireless communications happen to range from somewhere between 3 kilohertz and 300 gigahertz. This would probably be the lowest frequency that may be used for wireless communication, and this may be somewhat the highest frequency. Traditionally, this particular frequency range has been called the radio frequency signal range. That is the fundamental reason why wireless signals are interchangeably also called radio signals or radio frequency or RF signals because the frequency of those wireless signals happens to lie between the range specified by the traditional radio frequency range. a wireless or radio signal has two components, an electrical component, and a magnetic component, hence the name electromagnetic signals.RF signals are used as the so-called vehicle for information transfer because they carry your information from the transmitter to the receiver. These periodic RF signals or wireless signals are also known as carrier waves because they carry the information from one end to the other.Modulation is a process by which we impress or impose information onto the carrier wave for transmission. Modulation at the high level is about carefully changing some of the specific attributes of the radio-frequency signal. Two of those attributes, we have already learned about frequency and wavelength.Now, depending upon what type of information you originally wanted to send, either analog or digital, the corresponding modulation will be called analog modulation or digital modulation. It impresses the information onto the outgoing carrier wave in the process of modulation. At the receiver, however, the other end of wireless communication, we need to extract that information from the incoming carrier wave. That process of extraction is called demodulation. Demodulation is the process of recovering the data that has been impressed upon the carrier wave by the transmitter. What is the word modem? Well, it is an amalgamation of two words, modulation, and demodulation. That's why the word modem. That is because when the wireless device acts as a transmitter, it uses the modulation part of its functionality. Whereas when it acts as a receiver, it uses the demodulation aspects of its functionality. Because it can perform both the functionalities, that particular device is called modem.

# >What Happens During a Phone Conversation: Wireless Transmission and Reception

let's say that you have called your mom and the phone rang. She picked up the phone and you greeted her saying, hi, mom. When you say those words at a high level, that sound goes to the modulator inside your phone among other things. And as we know, modulator has the job of impressing that information, which is our greeting here on to a carrier wave. So modulator impresses that information onto a carrier wave. But the phone's internally work on a default frequency, which may be different from the frequency assigned to your phone by the network operator or the cellular provider. So your phone intrinsically converts that carrier wave into the specific frequency assigned to it by other network operator which has got upconversion. And once the signal is at the desired frequency, it undergoes a power amplification. 
Now, that radio frequency signal travels over the air and when it travels over the air it faces certain impediments. The most important and most significant of which is called attenuation or path loss or transmission loss. Let's say that after a certain amount of transmission loss, that signal reaches your mother's phone. So the incoming signal is also amplified inside your mother's phone. And because the transmitter phone had to upconvert in frequency the receiver's phone, we need to downconvert in frequency to convert that carrier away frequency into the default frequency that your phone can understand. And just like the transmitter's phone had to use the modulator functionality, the receiver's phone will need to use the demoderator functionality in order to extract the information that has been impressed upon the incoming carrier wave. And when your mother's phone is able to demodulate that information, that greeting is then converted into voice and that is the same greeting you sent her, hi, mom. And this is how when you talk to someone over phone they get to hear your voice and you in turn get to hear their voice. the signal from your phone actually goes over to a cell tower, technically known as a base station. So this cell tower is something that is deployed by your cellular network operator, towers that we see all around us. So the signal from your phone doesn't directly go to your mother's phone, it rather goes to a cell tower deployed by the network operator. The operator might perform some additional processing on that signal and then that signal is transmitted by the network operator cell tower to your mother's phone. So, in reality, this communication exchange is mediated by the cell tower and the signal doesn't directly go from one phone to another.called noise and interference. Now, the technical description of noise and interference and their significance is coming up shortly. noise and interference have the potential to change the appearance of the wireless signal when it actually reaches the receiver. And that has a couple of profound implications that will learn about shortly.

# >Noise and Interference

both noise and interference are forms of unwanted energy in addition to your intended energy. But noise is natural in sources, it is always present. You cannot minimize that beneath a certain threshold whereas interference is deliberate in nature and can be mitigated by careful planning of the frequency use by different entities in the network. For example, if you could institute certain rules saying that this transmitter cannot transmit at the same frequency or cannot transmit at the same time as transmitter 1, then you can tell that the interference shown here will be eliminated or greatly reduced if the transmitters follow those basic rules. It is possible to mitigate or altogether eliminate interference but not so much with noise. noise and interference play such a crucial role in a typical wireless system. The fundamental one is called SNR, or signal-to-noise ratio.in case of little noise or interference, the SNR or SINR may be very high. That is the point that a wireless system aims to operate at. Whereas if you gradually increase the amount of noise or interference relative to the strength of the desired signal, you can tell that mathematically, SNR or SINR will begin to gradually drop.

# >Radio Spectrum

Radio spectrum essentially is just the range of radio frequencies over which a wireless communication takes place, for a specific purpose. Just like how your car needs certain space on the road to be driven, any wireless or electromagnetic signal needs a certain space, so to speak, in the frequency domain for it to go from one point to another. That place in the frequency domain is nothing but radio spectrum. Now, frequencies or the radio spectrum that can be allocated for different purposes as we saw, can range from three kilohertz at the lowest to 300 gigahertz and the highest, which is our range of radio frequencies, as we established earlier. Specifically for mobile phones, it is still a broad range that those phones can use depending upon their generation. For example, some of the earliest mobile phones are operated in frequencies as low as 450 megahertz., whereas some of the intermediate generations, such as for 4G LTE, operate in frequencies that are as high as 2.6 gigahertz, somewhere over here. The upcoming technology 5G can operate in frequencies that are as high as 39 gigahertz. this frequency of 39 gigahertz has a very special significance. It is near and dear to the hearts of all the wireless engineers these days. In technical terms, that frequency is called millimeter wave. But apart from cellular phones, as you can see, there are many other purposes that the radio spectrum can be used for. For example, your citizen's band radio would use frequencies around 10 - 20 kilohertz. Your AM radio would use frequencies around, between one and two megahertz. Your FM radio would be somewhere around 100 megahertz, and your satellite TV or satellite radio would be somewhere around 25 gigahertz. Cell phones or mobile phones aren't the only wireless entities that utilize the radio spectrum, they are just one subset of the entire wireless ecosystem. There are many other services and devices that need to access radio spectrum, and at such those services are spread out across the entire radio spectrum.who makes these decisions? Who decided that 5G will operate over here, and FM radio will operate over here.In case of United States, that government regulatory entity is the FCC or Federal Communications Commission. Nearly any country has their own equivalent of FCC. The FCC equivalent has the primary responsibility to allocate and apportion frequency spectrum to different services depending upon the service needs and the needs of the propagation environment. For example, it was the FCC who decided, for example, that AM radio would operate here, and FM radio would operate here, and mobile communications would get these type of frequency ranges. It is the local regulatory authority that determines what spectrum will be used by what service, for what purpose.

# >Radio Channel and Bandwidth

When your phone transmits or receives a signal, it only uses a small subset or a sliver of the frequency spectrum. And that limited range of frequencies over which a wireless device, exchanges wireless or radio signals, it's called its frequency channel. And the word of the frequency channel currently being used by a wireless device, it's called the channel bandwidth. there are roughly two classifications of a wireless channel, narrowband and wideband. In narrowband channel, as the definition says, occupies just a small amount of radio spectrum, on the order of a few kilohertz or a few thousand hertz. Whereas a wideband channel, occupies a large amount of radio spectrum relatively higher than the narrowband channel, on the order of few megahertz or millions of hertz. And as the logic might go, a narrow band channel, given everything else equal, will help you send limited amount of data. And a wideband channel on the other hand, can help you send a large amount of data. so, you think that every channel will be wide band channel but no .A corollary of availability is because spectrum is a scarce resource. It begins to get more and more expensive as you begin to buy more and more spectrum. So if you had to buy a wideband channel for every user, your system will be extremely expensive because spectrum is inherently a scarce and expensive commodity. So availability and costs are a couple of reasons for which not every channel can be a wideband channel. But beyond that, there is one more reason, for which not every user can get a wideband channel, and that is precisely what we are going to look at next.

# >Sharing the Radio Channel

can different users share this data pipe or the wireless channel? And the answer to that question is absolutely yes. There are defined algorithms that allow sharing of the radio channel and that translates to a concept of multiple access. Meaning that when multiple users are trying to access the same wireless channel at the same time, that concept is called multiple access and that is not very difficult to understand. For example, consider that there is only one user at a given point in time. So, the entire pipe for the entire wireless channel will be available to that user and that will be equivalent of a wideband channel. But now, consider that there are three more users trying to utilize the same wireless channel. So, in the interest of fairness or equity, all the users will get a certain sliver of that wireless channel depending upon their application requirements. And the wireless system will have to divide the available resources, the number of users that are trying to access the system at the same time. And that is what makes shared data channel like a shared a pipe. And there are trade offs to be achieved on this front, just like there are tradeoffs with many other engineering problems. In that, because the users now have to share the wireless channel stands to reason that each of them will get fewer wireless resources than they were if they were the only user trying to access the wireless channel. So that is a slight disadvantage, but a big advantage in favor of multiple access is that you don't have to allocate or buy individual dedicated channels for individual users. Which would be prohibitively expensive, given how scarce and costly the frequency spectrum is getting these days. So, multiple access allows us to achieve that desirable trade off between the cost of the frequency spectrum you need to operate your system. We're says the amount of resources individual users get which ultimately determines the speed or the data rate that they will get on their phones. a technology called CDMA that was a technology pioneered by qualcomm in the mid nineties. The MA in CDMA stands for multiple access, and what does multiple access mean? In general, just like modulation entails carefully changing certain attributes of the wireless signal you are trying to send out multiple access involves carefully leveraging some of the attributes of the wireless channel. Wireless channel, as we'll see, has different attributes, such as frequency time, etc. And if different users can carefully leverage some of those attributes that constitutes multiple access. So, these are the couple of quick notes about multiple access, which is a fundamental concept that allows multiple users to share the scarce and limited frequency resources, ie a wireless channel.

# >Two Ways of Sharing the Spectrum: FDD & TDD

Now all these users were users like your phones or your tablets. But what about the cell tower or the base station as we have talked about earlier, does it utilize the same resources as your phone, or does it utilize different resources from your phone? Well, the answer is, it depends. That leads us to two distinct variants of wireless communication called FDD and TDD, which respectively stand for frequency division duplexing and time division duplexing.they are simply two ways to share the limited and expensive spectrum. But in this particular context, they aren't necessarily the way to share the spectrum among other users on the phone. Rather, they are other ways to share spectrum between the cell tower or the base station and the rest of the phones.FDD, it stands for frequency division duplexing, entails and requires rather a pair of radio channels for simultaneous two-way communication. For example, if you have abundant frequency spectrum, you could allocate one channel on which your cell tower would transmit. You could allocate a different independent frequency channel on which your phone would transmit. In technical parlance, now the transmissions that are sent by the base station or the cell tower are called downlink and the transmissions that are sent by your phone are called uplink. It is called so because traditionally base station is located at a larger height, it is taller than normal users, and hence, the signal from the base station comes down to you. Whereas, when your phone transmits a signal to a base station because base station is located at a higher level, the phone signal has to travel upwards, so to speak. That's why the name downlink, whereas this is uplink. In FDD, your system is rich enough to buy two separate channels. One channel, wherein only the base station will transmit and the phone will only receive on the channel. Whereas on the second uplink channel, it is only the phone that is allowed to transmit, and the base station will only need to receive on that channel. There is separation of responsibilities in the frequency domain, so to speak. There are, as always, pros and cons. The pros are that, as the first point mentions here, because those two are independent channels, it allows for simultaneous two-way communications. In that the base station can transmit something to the phone on the downlink. At the same time while the phone is listening, it can also try to send some information to the same base station on the uplink, thus allow for two-way communication. However, the basic disadvantage of this FDD mechanism is that you have to have enough budget in order to buy two separate frequency channels. Not only that, your local regulatory authorities have to have abundance spectrum available in order to allocate two independent channels for your system. One for downlink, one for uplink. TDD, also known as time division duplexing. As you may have guessed, it is called so because it leverages the time aspect of the wireless channel. The hallmark of a TDD system is that, unlike an FDD system, a TDD system has access to only one frequency channel. There are no two frequency channels anymore. Both the base station and your phones have to operate on the same frequency channel. Single radio channel is the basic characteristic of a TDD system. But if you have to accommodate transmissions in two different directions on the same channel, how can you make that happen? Well, that is where leveraging the time attribute of the channel comes into picture. For example, on the same channel, you might have the base station transmits from, let's say, time t1 to t2. From time t2 to t3, you will open that channel up for the other direction of transmission, that is uplink. Once again, if the operating data demand has been satisfied, you can open the same channel back to the base station from t3 to t4. Once again, from t4 to t5, you can let the phone transmit. Because you have just one frequency channel, you effectively have to alternate between the downlink and uplink on the base station transmissions and the transmission by your phone.a TDD system, given everything else equal, will be cheaper to implement as compared to an FDD system. 

# >Factors Affecting Data Rate

First of which is how many bars does your phone have, which ultimately translates to how good is your connection. This would be the equivalent of the quality of the rules. If you have more bars, it naturally means that your signal is of better quality. And that means that your SNR or signal to noise ratio, Higher the SNR given everything else equal, higher data rate you will be able to achieve. The second is how wide is my channel and how crowded it is. if a channel is wide, it is said to have higher channel capacity. if there are many users trying to access the same wireless channel at the same time, the channel be loaded with users, so to speak, and that is what we call network load. So the width of your channel and the crowd on that channel, meaning network load are also a couple of important factors that impact your data rate. The third factor is how frequently and how efficiently can the phone use this available channel? If the phone can utilize the channel more frequently, your phone will be able to get higher data rates. And if your phone, whenever it gets to utilize the wireless channel can utilize that channel with more efficiency. higher the spectral efficiency, higher the data rate or higher the speed will be because you are using the existing resources with more efficiency. Now, spectral efficiency,If you could operate your system more efficiently, you can utilize the same existing amount of resources more efficiently and improve your performance, which in this context would be your speed or your data rate, technically also known as throughput. And given that these three factors are closely impact throughput and throughput ultimately impacts user experience and customer satisfaction. Wireless network operators spend a good deal of time, money, and other resources in order to optimize all these factors, i.e., maximize the SNR, maximize channel capacity but minimize network load, and maximize spectral efficiency in order to maximize user experience and customer satisfaction.

# >The Cellular Concept

if you compare a modern cellular network to a legacy wireless network such as FM radio, we'll notice that FM radio and a cellular network  in entirely different manner. An FM radio usually broadcasts its signal from just one common tower, let's say towards the center of a town and the whole town gets the exact same FM signal because they are trying to listen to the same song or the same broadcast at the same time. However, the mobile network covers the same city differently. A mobile network's coverage area is divided into what are called cells, the small areas which are called cells. That is where the name cellular communication or cellular network derives from. Because the area is covered into many different cells of small size and each of those individual cells is served by what is known as a base station. In proverbial terms, it is also known as the cell tower or simply the tower. Those are the same cell towers that you see all around us. Sometimes they are mounted a top a tall structure or sometimes they are just on the facades of residential or commercial buildings. But nonetheless, no matter what shape or form they take, in a cellular network, one tower or one base station is responsible for providing coverage to a limited geographical area that is called the cell. Different cells are designed in such a way that they have perfectly oscillating coverage.  Cellular networks are designed in an analogous manner to provide oscillating coverage and in most cases, if not all, no matter where you are, you are provided a cellular service from the nearest base station.First of all, we have shown a neatly hexagonal oscillating pattern as the shape of a cell. But in reality, that is not how cells look like. In reality, hardly any cell will ever have such a neat hexagonal pattern. Cells have somewhat different radiation and coverage pattern. However, we stick to this hexagonal pattern as the first step because it serves as a very powerful illustrative model of the concept of oscillation and the concept of cellularization. Once we have this basic concept in mind at a theoretical level, with the help of these hexagons, we can translate that understanding into real networks wherein cells tend to have slightly irregular shapes. But even though they have irregular shapes, network operators make sure that the entire geographical area is covered by at least one cell if not more than that. That said, in reality it is possible for certain small areas to lack cell coverage, which are proverbially also called coverage rules. For example, there is a base station over here. But if there is a building in the middle that is taller than the base station itself, then stands to reason that the signal from this base station may have a little difficulty reaching this point beyond a tall building. Or if there's a mountain or a hill, you can have a similar effect. In case of such obstructions, it is possible for certain points in a cellular network to be devoid of a cellular or wireless coverage and it is possible that if your phone goes into such an area that lacks sufficient wireless coverage, your phone can temporarily lose wireless service.The basic principle of modern cellular network design involves minimizing the number of dropped calls, while at the same time, maximizing the data rate that you get on your phone and the coverage area, while also limiting the number of towers that you have to build. I think we are all in agreement about these two points. That is, we have to minimize the number of dropped calls and maximize data rate and coverage area. You have to maximize the data rate and coverage area while keeping the number of base stations at a minimum.

# >What Is A Cellular Network?

A regardless of the generation be it, 2G, 3G, 4G or 5G, which are the generations of cellular communications. the services that your phone is trying to access. Be it news, be it whether, be it email or be it video streaming, be it picture sharing or be it video telephone, etc. Whatever those services are, those services are present at the other end of the connection. And in between is what we proverbially call the cellular network that is deployed by your cellular network operator. Now, a cellular network has two fundamental components, one is called RAN or Radio Access Network, the second is called Core Network. Let's try to understand those one at a time. The RAN comprises multiple base stations or cell towers and these are the entities as we have seen that exchange wireless signals with your phone. So when your phone powers up and tries to send wireless signals somewhere, a base station that is nearest to your fourth is the entity that ultimately receives those wireless transmissions.

And as I also mentioned at a given point in time, you will be served by the base station that is closest to you. But when you move you may be handed off from one base station to another. And for that purpose two things have to happen, your network operator has to have a nationwide deployment of such base stations. And secondly those base stations have to be interconnected to each other directly or indirectly so that they can communicate with each other. So that they can ensure that your handover will be successful when you move from one base station to another.  A typical network operator in order to provide nationwide coverage might end up deploying literally tens of thousands of base stations. So all those base stations comprise what is known as the RAN or Radio Access Network. And those are the cell towers or the base stations for example, go to a cellular network operator store and purchase a subscription you get the same card. The network operator assigns you certain credentials. Are those credentials stored with every base station? No, not really, those credentials are stored in a central repository that is a part of the second half of the cellular network that is called the core network. So core network is the central repository where the data regarding your subscription etc will be stored. And apart from that, core network has another important functionality in that it is supposed to be the routing bridge between your phone and the services network over here.your services network doesn't know where you are located or what base station you are being served by. And that is where Core Network steps in, it acts as the middleman between your phone and the services network. That way, when the email server in the services network sends your individual email package to you, they first land on the Core Network. Core Network forward those email package to the precise base station that is serving you at that point in time. And that base station sends you those email package over your wireless channel, so this is how cellular communication works into it.
