## 1 MODULE: wireless communications and cellular networks

# >wireless signal basic
first we will understand what factors ultimately impact the speed of the data rate that you get on your phone. Now, wireless communication allows transfer of information between a transmitter and a receiver without a physical medium. Emphasis on that clause, "without a physical medium." That is because many other forms of communications that we engage in on a daily basis require some or the other form of a medium. For example, a landline phone, if you have one at home, the signal for the landline phone comes over a wire, hence the name landline. Even our modern-day internet connection is actually delivered to your home using some form of an internet cable. Even when we speak with each other, our voice requires an explicit medium such as air or other solid medium to go from one point to another. In contrast to all of those examples, wireless communication does not need a physical medium. It can travel just as well in a vacuum space, so to speak. 

a typical wireless communication system has four fundamental components; A transmitter, a receiver, a wireless signal, and a fourth imaginary entity that is called a wireless channel.What is a transmitter?The entity that is looking to transmit some data to the other end over a wireless medium, that will be called the transmitter. On the other hand, the entity that is looking to receive that data will be called the receiver. In modern-day communication systems, most devices have the capability to act as both the transmitter as well as the receiver, either at the same time or at different points in time. As we all know, our antennas are also an integral part of any transmitter or receiver, because that is what helps you send or receive wireless signals. That brings us to the other two entities in a typical wireless system namely wireless signals are also called radio-frequency signals or RF Signals, and the imaginary channel over which those wireless signals go from one point to another called either the wireless channel or the radio channel. 

# >Radio Signal Properties, Carrier Waves and Modulation

all wireless signals travel at the speed of light, which is approximately 300,000 kilometers per second or about 186,000 miles per second and periodic in nature. In that, they show a certain pattern and that pattern repeats as a function of time. That fundamental periodic nature leads us to two basic attributes of radio frequency signals, namely frequency and wavelength.Frequency is the number of repetitions that the periodic electromagnetic signal undergoes in a given second, and the frequency is measured in the unit of hertz. Wavelength, on the other hand, is the distance that periodic wireless signal travels during one cycle or one periodicity, and because it is a measure of distance, it is mostly measured in meters or millimeters equivalently.If you multiply frequency and wavelength of a wireless radio signal, you get the speed of that radio signal, which as we know now is the universal constant, that is, the speed of light. Frequency and wavelength of a wireless signal are inversely related. The relational constant being the universal constant, the speed of light. The radio signals that are used for wireless communications happen to range from somewhere between 3 kilohertz and 300 gigahertz. This would probably be the lowest frequency that may be used for wireless communication, and this may be somewhat the highest frequency. Traditionally, this particular frequency range has been called the radio frequency signal range. That is the fundamental reason why wireless signals are interchangeably also called radio signals or radio frequency or RF signals because the frequency of those wireless signals happens to lie between the range specified by the traditional radio frequency range. a wireless or radio signal has two components, an electrical component, and a magnetic component, hence the name electromagnetic signals.RF signals are used as the so-called vehicle for information transfer because they carry your information from the transmitter to the receiver. These periodic RF signals or wireless signals are also known as carrier waves because they carry the information from one end to the other.Modulation is a process by which we impress or impose information onto the carrier wave for transmission. Modulation at the high level is about carefully changing some of the specific attributes of the radio-frequency signal. Two of those attributes, we have already learned about frequency and wavelength.Now, depending upon what type of information you originally wanted to send, either analog or digital, the corresponding modulation will be called analog modulation or digital modulation. It impresses the information onto the outgoing carrier wave in the process of modulation. At the receiver, however, the other end of wireless communication, we need to extract that information from the incoming carrier wave. That process of extraction is called demodulation. Demodulation is the process of recovering the data that has been impressed upon the carrier wave by the transmitter. What is the word modem? Well, it is an amalgamation of two words, modulation, and demodulation. That's why the word modem. That is because when the wireless device acts as a transmitter, it uses the modulation part of its functionality. Whereas when it acts as a receiver, it uses the demodulation aspects of its functionality. Because it can perform both the functionalities, that particular device is called modem.

# >What Happens During a Phone Conversation: Wireless Transmission and Reception

let's say that you have called your mom and the phone rang. She picked up the phone and you greeted her saying, hi, mom. When you say those words at a high level, that sound goes to the modulator inside your phone among other things. And as we know, modulator has the job of impressing that information, which is our greeting here on to a carrier wave. So modulator impresses that information onto a carrier wave. But the phone's internally work on a default frequency, which may be different from the frequency assigned to your phone by the network operator or the cellular provider. So your phone intrinsically converts that carrier wave into the specific frequency assigned to it by other network operator which has got upconversion. And once the signal is at the desired frequency, it undergoes a power amplification. 
Now, that radio frequency signal travels over the air and when it travels over the air it faces certain impediments. The most important and most significant of which is called attenuation or path loss or transmission loss. Let's say that after a certain amount of transmission loss, that signal reaches your mother's phone. So the incoming signal is also amplified inside your mother's phone. And because the transmitter phone had to upconvert in frequency the receiver's phone, we need to downconvert in frequency to convert that carrier away frequency into the default frequency that your phone can understand. And just like the transmitter's phone had to use the modulator functionality, the receiver's phone will need to use the demoderator functionality in order to extract the information that has been impressed upon the incoming carrier wave. And when your mother's phone is able to demodulate that information, that greeting is then converted into voice and that is the same greeting you sent her, hi, mom. And this is how when you talk to someone over phone they get to hear your voice and you in turn get to hear their voice. the signal from your phone actually goes over to a cell tower, technically known as a base station. So this cell tower is something that is deployed by your cellular network operator, towers that we see all around us. So the signal from your phone doesn't directly go to your mother's phone, it rather goes to a cell tower deployed by the network operator. The operator might perform some additional processing on that signal and then that signal is transmitted by the network operator cell tower to your mother's phone. So, in reality, this communication exchange is mediated by the cell tower and the signal doesn't directly go from one phone to another.called noise and interference. Now, the technical description of noise and interference and their significance is coming up shortly. noise and interference have the potential to change the appearance of the wireless signal when it actually reaches the receiver. And that has a couple of profound implications that will learn about shortly.

# >Noise and Interference

both noise and interference are forms of unwanted energy in addition to your intended energy. But noise is natural in sources, it is always present. You cannot minimize that beneath a certain threshold whereas interference is deliberate in nature and can be mitigated by careful planning of the frequency use by different entities in the network. For example, if you could institute certain rules saying that this transmitter cannot transmit at the same frequency or cannot transmit at the same time as transmitter 1, then you can tell that the interference shown here will be eliminated or greatly reduced if the transmitters follow those basic rules. It is possible to mitigate or altogether eliminate interference but not so much with noise. noise and interference play such a crucial role in a typical wireless system. The fundamental one is called SNR, or signal-to-noise ratio.in case of little noise or interference, the SNR or SINR may be very high. That is the point that a wireless system aims to operate at. Whereas if you gradually increase the amount of noise or interference relative to the strength of the desired signal, you can tell that mathematically, SNR or SINR will begin to gradually drop.

# >Radio Spectrum

Radio spectrum essentially is just the range of radio frequencies over which a wireless communication takes place, for a specific purpose. Just like how your car needs certain space on the road to be driven, any wireless or electromagnetic signal needs a certain space, so to speak, in the frequency domain for it to go from one point to another. That place in the frequency domain is nothing but radio spectrum. Now, frequencies or the radio spectrum that can be allocated for different purposes as we saw, can range from three kilohertz at the lowest to 300 gigahertz and the highest, which is our range of radio frequencies, as we established earlier. Specifically for mobile phones, it is still a broad range that those phones can use depending upon their generation. For example, some of the earliest mobile phones are operated in frequencies as low as 450 megahertz., whereas some of the intermediate generations, such as for 4G LTE, operate in frequencies that are as high as 2.6 gigahertz, somewhere over here. The upcoming technology 5G can operate in frequencies that are as high as 39 gigahertz. this frequency of 39 gigahertz has a very special significance. It is near and dear to the hearts of all the wireless engineers these days. In technical terms, that frequency is called millimeter wave. But apart from cellular phones, as you can see, there are many other purposes that the radio spectrum can be used for. For example, your citizen's band radio would use frequencies around 10 - 20 kilohertz. Your AM radio would use frequencies around, between one and two megahertz. Your FM radio would be somewhere around 100 megahertz, and your satellite TV or satellite radio would be somewhere around 25 gigahertz. Cell phones or mobile phones aren't the only wireless entities that utilize the radio spectrum, they are just one subset of the entire wireless ecosystem. There are many other services and devices that need to access radio spectrum, and at such those services are spread out across the entire radio spectrum.who makes these decisions? Who decided that 5G will operate over here, and FM radio will operate over here.In case of United States, that government regulatory entity is the FCC or Federal Communications Commission. Nearly any country has their own equivalent of FCC. The FCC equivalent has the primary responsibility to allocate and apportion frequency spectrum to different services depending upon the service needs and the needs of the propagation environment. For example, it was the FCC who decided, for example, that AM radio would operate here, and FM radio would operate here, and mobile communications would get these type of frequency ranges. It is the local regulatory authority that determines what spectrum will be used by what service, for what purpose.

# >Radio Channel and Bandwidth

When your phone transmits or receives a signal, it only uses a small subset or a sliver of the frequency spectrum. And that limited range of frequencies over which a wireless device, exchanges wireless or radio signals, it's called its frequency channel. And the word of the frequency channel currently being used by a wireless device, it's called the channel bandwidth. there are roughly two classifications of a wireless channel, narrowband and wideband. In narrowband channel, as the definition says, occupies just a small amount of radio spectrum, on the order of a few kilohertz or a few thousand hertz. Whereas a wideband channel, occupies a large amount of radio spectrum relatively higher than the narrowband channel, on the order of few megahertz or millions of hertz. And as the logic might go, a narrow band channel, given everything else equal, will help you send limited amount of data. And a wideband channel on the other hand, can help you send a large amount of data. so, you think that every channel will be wide band channel but no .A corollary of availability is because spectrum is a scarce resource. It begins to get more and more expensive as you begin to buy more and more spectrum. So if you had to buy a wideband channel for every user, your system will be extremely expensive because spectrum is inherently a scarce and expensive commodity. So availability and costs are a couple of reasons for which not every channel can be a wideband channel. But beyond that, there is one more reason, for which not every user can get a wideband channel, and that is precisely what we are going to look at next.

# >Sharing the Radio Channel

can different users share this data pipe or the wireless channel? And the answer to that question is absolutely yes. There are defined algorithms that allow sharing of the radio channel and that translates to a concept of multiple access. Meaning that when multiple users are trying to access the same wireless channel at the same time, that concept is called multiple access and that is not very difficult to understand. For example, consider that there is only one user at a given point in time. So, the entire pipe for the entire wireless channel will be available to that user and that will be equivalent of a wideband channel. But now, consider that there are three more users trying to utilize the same wireless channel. So, in the interest of fairness or equity, all the users will get a certain sliver of that wireless channel depending upon their application requirements. And the wireless system will have to divide the available resources, the number of users that are trying to access the system at the same time. And that is what makes shared data channel like a shared a pipe. And there are trade offs to be achieved on this front, just like there are tradeoffs with many other engineering problems. In that, because the users now have to share the wireless channel stands to reason that each of them will get fewer wireless resources than they were if they were the only user trying to access the wireless channel. So that is a slight disadvantage, but a big advantage in favor of multiple access is that you don't have to allocate or buy individual dedicated channels for individual users. Which would be prohibitively expensive, given how scarce and costly the frequency spectrum is getting these days. So, multiple access allows us to achieve that desirable trade off between the cost of the frequency spectrum you need to operate your system. We're says the amount of resources individual users get which ultimately determines the speed or the data rate that they will get on their phones. a technology called CDMA that was a technology pioneered by qualcomm in the mid nineties. The MA in CDMA stands for multiple access, and what does multiple access mean? In general, just like modulation entails carefully changing certain attributes of the wireless signal you are trying to send out multiple access involves carefully leveraging some of the attributes of the wireless channel. Wireless channel, as we'll see, has different attributes, such as frequency time, etc. And if different users can carefully leverage some of those attributes that constitutes multiple access. So, these are the couple of quick notes about multiple access, which is a fundamental concept that allows multiple users to share the scarce and limited frequency resources, ie a wireless channel.

# >Two Ways of Sharing the Spectrum: FDD & TDD

Now all these users were users like your phones or your tablets. But what about the cell tower or the base station as we have talked about earlier, does it utilize the same resources as your phone, or does it utilize different resources from your phone? Well, the answer is, it depends. That leads us to two distinct variants of wireless communication called FDD and TDD, which respectively stand for frequency division duplexing and time division duplexing.they are simply two ways to share the limited and expensive spectrum. But in this particular context, they aren't necessarily the way to share the spectrum among other users on the phone. Rather, they are other ways to share spectrum between the cell tower or the base station and the rest of the phones.FDD, it stands for frequency division duplexing, entails and requires rather a pair of radio channels for simultaneous two-way communication. For example, if you have abundant frequency spectrum, you could allocate one channel on which your cell tower would transmit. You could allocate a different independent frequency channel on which your phone would transmit. In technical parlance, now the transmissions that are sent by the base station or the cell tower are called downlink and the transmissions that are sent by your phone are called uplink. It is called so because traditionally base station is located at a larger height, it is taller than normal users, and hence, the signal from the base station comes down to you. Whereas, when your phone transmits a signal to a base station because base station is located at a higher level, the phone signal has to travel upwards, so to speak. That's why the name downlink, whereas this is uplink. In FDD, your system is rich enough to buy two separate channels. One channel, wherein only the base station will transmit and the phone will only receive on the channel. Whereas on the second uplink channel, it is only the phone that is allowed to transmit, and the base station will only need to receive on that channel. There is separation of responsibilities in the frequency domain, so to speak. There are, as always, pros and cons. The pros are that, as the first point mentions here, because those two are independent channels, it allows for simultaneous two-way communications. In that the base station can transmit something to the phone on the downlink. At the same time while the phone is listening, it can also try to send some information to the same base station on the uplink, thus allow for two-way communication. However, the basic disadvantage of this FDD mechanism is that you have to have enough budget in order to buy two separate frequency channels. Not only that, your local regulatory authorities have to have abundance spectrum available in order to allocate two independent channels for your system. One for downlink, one for uplink. TDD, also known as time division duplexing. As you may have guessed, it is called so because it leverages the time aspect of the wireless channel. The hallmark of a TDD system is that, unlike an FDD system, a TDD system has access to only one frequency channel. There are no two frequency channels anymore. Both the base station and your phones have to operate on the same frequency channel. Single radio channel is the basic characteristic of a TDD system. But if you have to accommodate transmissions in two different directions on the same channel, how can you make that happen? Well, that is where leveraging the time attribute of the channel comes into picture. For example, on the same channel, you might have the base station transmits from, let's say, time t1 to t2. From time t2 to t3, you will open that channel up for the other direction of transmission, that is uplink. Once again, if the operating data demand has been satisfied, you can open the same channel back to the base station from t3 to t4. Once again, from t4 to t5, you can let the phone transmit. Because you have just one frequency channel, you effectively have to alternate between the downlink and uplink on the base station transmissions and the transmission by your phone.a TDD system, given everything else equal, will be cheaper to implement as compared to an FDD system. 

# >Factors Affecting Data Rate

First of which is how many bars does your phone have, which ultimately translates to how good is your connection. This would be the equivalent of the quality of the rules. If you have more bars, it naturally means that your signal is of better quality. And that means that your SNR or signal to noise ratio, Higher the SNR given everything else equal, higher data rate you will be able to achieve. The second is how wide is my channel and how crowded it is. if a channel is wide, it is said to have higher channel capacity. if there are many users trying to access the same wireless channel at the same time, the channel be loaded with users, so to speak, and that is what we call network load. So the width of your channel and the crowd on that channel, meaning network load are also a couple of important factors that impact your data rate. The third factor is how frequently and how efficiently can the phone use this available channel? If the phone can utilize the channel more frequently, your phone will be able to get higher data rates. And if your phone, whenever it gets to utilize the wireless channel can utilize that channel with more efficiency. higher the spectral efficiency, higher the data rate or higher the speed will be because you are using the existing resources with more efficiency. Now, spectral efficiency,If you could operate your system more efficiently, you can utilize the same existing amount of resources more efficiently and improve your performance, which in this context would be your speed or your data rate, technically also known as throughput. And given that these three factors are closely impact throughput and throughput ultimately impacts user experience and customer satisfaction. Wireless network operators spend a good deal of time, money, and other resources in order to optimize all these factors, i.e., maximize the SNR, maximize channel capacity but minimize network load, and maximize spectral efficiency in order to maximize user experience and customer satisfaction.

# >The Cellular Concept

if you compare a modern cellular network to a legacy wireless network such as FM radio, we'll notice that FM radio and a cellular network  in entirely different manner. An FM radio usually broadcasts its signal from just one common tower, let's say towards the center of a town and the whole town gets the exact same FM signal because they are trying to listen to the same song or the same broadcast at the same time. However, the mobile network covers the same city differently. A mobile network's coverage area is divided into what are called cells, the small areas which are called cells. That is where the name cellular communication or cellular network derives from. Because the area is covered into many different cells of small size and each of those individual cells is served by what is known as a base station. In proverbial terms, it is also known as the cell tower or simply the tower. Those are the same cell towers that you see all around us. Sometimes they are mounted a top a tall structure or sometimes they are just on the facades of residential or commercial buildings. But nonetheless, no matter what shape or form they take, in a cellular network, one tower or one base station is responsible for providing coverage to a limited geographical area that is called the cell. Different cells are designed in such a way that they have perfectly oscillating coverage.  Cellular networks are designed in an analogous manner to provide oscillating coverage and in most cases, if not all, no matter where you are, you are provided a cellular service from the nearest base station.First of all, we have shown a neatly hexagonal oscillating pattern as the shape of a cell. But in reality, that is not how cells look like. In reality, hardly any cell will ever have such a neat hexagonal pattern. Cells have somewhat different radiation and coverage pattern. However, we stick to this hexagonal pattern as the first step because it serves as a very powerful illustrative model of the concept of oscillation and the concept of cellularization. Once we have this basic concept in mind at a theoretical level, with the help of these hexagons, we can translate that understanding into real networks wherein cells tend to have slightly irregular shapes. But even though they have irregular shapes, network operators make sure that the entire geographical area is covered by at least one cell if not more than that. That said, in reality it is possible for certain small areas to lack cell coverage, which are proverbially also called coverage rules. For example, there is a base station over here. But if there is a building in the middle that is taller than the base station itself, then stands to reason that the signal from this base station may have a little difficulty reaching this point beyond a tall building. Or if there's a mountain or a hill, you can have a similar effect. In case of such obstructions, it is possible for certain points in a cellular network to be devoid of a cellular or wireless coverage and it is possible that if your phone goes into such an area that lacks sufficient wireless coverage, your phone can temporarily lose wireless service.The basic principle of modern cellular network design involves minimizing the number of dropped calls, while at the same time, maximizing the data rate that you get on your phone and the coverage area, while also limiting the number of towers that you have to build. I think we are all in agreement about these two points. That is, we have to minimize the number of dropped calls and maximize data rate and coverage area. You have to maximize the data rate and coverage area while keeping the number of base stations at a minimum.

# >What Is A Cellular Network?

A regardless of the generation be it, 2G, 3G, 4G or 5G, which are the generations of cellular communications. the services that your phone is trying to access. Be it news, be it whether, be it email or be it video streaming, be it picture sharing or be it video telephone, etc. Whatever those services are, those services are present at the other end of the connection. And in between is what we proverbially call the cellular network that is deployed by your cellular network operator. Now, a cellular network has two fundamental components, one is called RAN or Radio Access Network, the second is called Core Network. Let's try to understand those one at a time. The RAN comprises multiple base stations or cell towers and these are the entities as we have seen that exchange wireless signals with your phone. So when your phone powers up and tries to send wireless signals somewhere, a base station that is nearest to your fourth is the entity that ultimately receives those wireless transmissions.

And as I also mentioned at a given point in time, you will be served by the base station that is closest to you. But when you move you may be handed off from one base station to another. And for that purpose two things have to happen, your network operator has to have a nationwide deployment of such base stations. And secondly those base stations have to be interconnected to each other directly or indirectly so that they can communicate with each other. So that they can ensure that your handover will be successful when you move from one base station to another.  A typical network operator in order to provide nationwide coverage might end up deploying literally tens of thousands of base stations. So all those base stations comprise what is known as the RAN or Radio Access Network. And those are the cell towers or the base stations for example, go to a cellular network operator store and purchase a subscription you get the same card. The network operator assigns you certain credentials. Are those credentials stored with every base station? No, not really, those credentials are stored in a central repository that is a part of the second half of the cellular network that is called the core network. So core network is the central repository where the data regarding your subscription etc will be stored. And apart from that, core network has another important functionality in that it is supposed to be the routing bridge between your phone and the services network over here.your services network doesn't know where you are located or what base station you are being served by. And that is where Core Network steps in, it acts as the middleman between your phone and the services network. That way, when the email server in the services network sends your individual email package to you, they first land on the Core Network. Core Network forward those email package to the precise base station that is serving you at that point in time. And that base station sends you those email package over your wireless channel, so this is how cellular communication works into it.


## 2 MODULE: WHAT IS 5G AND WHY WE NEED IT?

# >Evolution of Wireless Technologies

Now that we have learned about some of the fundamentals of wireless communications and seen how a general cellular communication network looks like, let's try to get more background on a cellular network, starting with how cellular communications have evolved over the generations and what brings us to the current generation of cellular communication and potentially what might take us beyond, i.e 5G. We will learn about what are some of the fundamental premises that 5G makes pursuant to some of the strict requirements that have been put forth for 5G, which will correctly set the foundation for the rest of this class. Cellular communications, as we know today, really started in the 1970s and '80s with what is retroactively now known as the first generation of cellular communications, i.e 1G. The predominant use case at that time was to enable people to make and receive voice calls on the go wherever they were. Maybe they were in a car, maybe they were in a shopping mall, in the movie theater, whatever, the use case was to enable them to make and receive voice calls no matter where they were. That's why the hallmark application of the first generation of cellular networks was voice. Now you will see a little qualifier there, see analog voice. You might wonder, hey, isn't our voice analog by default? Why do you need to say analog voice? Well, when we think of voice or any data in terms of communication, we not only have to worry about how that data is produced but rather how that data is transmitted. In the first generation of cellular communications, our analog voice was imposed onto the outgoing carrier wave using analog modulation, something that we learned about in the previous module. Because our analog voice was transmitted over the air using analog modulation, that is the reason why you see the qualifier there as analog voice. First-generation of cellular networks is really where everything started in the 1970s and 1980s. Then came the second generation of cellular technologies, are proverbially known as 2G, sometime in the '90s. The fundamental focus was still on providing voice services but now you will see a different qualifier and that is for a well-merited reason. What you see here is not analog voice, but digital voice. What is digital voice? You might wonder. Well, our voice fundamentally, as we produce it continues to remain analog, no question about that. But in the second generation of cellular communication, the modulation technique that would be used to super-impose our voice onto the outgoing carrier wave would be digital modulation. In that modulator, in your phone, would convert your analog voice into a digital stream of bits and bytes, essentially a sequence of ones and zeros, and that sequence of ones and zeros are other than your analog voice, would be used to modulate an outgoing carrier wave. Why would we do that? Well, that is a separate discussion, but at a high level, there are certain quantifiable benefits to digitizing your voice. Not only can you compress and encrypt or encode a digital stream better than you can in analog stream, but other quality with which you can reproduce and transmit digital sound happens to be better than the quantity that analog voice can offer. That is a fundamental reason why other electronic ecosystem as a whole moved from analog voice to digital voice. But nonetheless, for second generation of cellular communication, our voice continued to be the predominant use case although text messaging had started to be popular by that time. That brought us to the third generation of cellular communication, also known as 3G, sometime in the first decade of this century. That is the first generation wherein we had seamless access to mobile Internet. For the first time, we had seamless access to all the resources available on the Internet. Be it as simple as news or weather forecast, or be it as specialized and complex as video broadcast, audio broadcast, or email, for example. So 3G was the first generation that truly offered mobile Internet. The speeds were somewhat limited compared to what we have today on the order of few 100 Kbps or a few Mbps. But suffice it to say that those speeds were more than sufficient to cover all the use cases that we had at that time. But the fundamental benefit of bringing internet connection to all the mobile phones was that it ultimately led to the invention of smartphones, which led to the advent of the next generation of cellular communications that is 4G, also known as LTE. Now, LTE made a few changes to the fundamental network architecture, which gave us some extraordinary benefits. Not only did it magnify the available data rates, from a few Mbps to a few 100 Mbps and then more than one gigabits per second, but it also greatly expanded the mobile ecosystem from just cell phones to other devices that had started cropping up at that time, for example, tablets, fitness trackers, virtual reality goggles or even connected cars, smart home devices, etc. 4G not only improved the speeds that it would offer to your mobile phones, but it also greatly expanded the Ecosystem beyond just everyday phones into the realm of tablets, smart home device, fitness trackers, etc. That was the fundamental power of 4G in that it expanded our ecosystem. Thankfully, that trend of ecosystem expansion has continued till date in that more and more devices of different varieties are asking network connectivity more reliably. Not only that, they are expecting higher and higher speeds and lower and lower lag from the network that they connect to. Given that the ecosystem has been expanding at a rapid clip. That brings us to ask one fundamental question. Is 4G or any legacy technology for that matter, truly sufficient to meet the requirements, not just for today, but continue meeting those requirements tomorrow and beyond? Is 4G truly sufficient? Is it a future-proof technology or is it going to be not sufficient beyond a certain point? Which will bring us to think about the next generation of cellular technologies, which will be called 5G. Let's try to answer that fundamental question whether there are any use cases or applications that 4G, cannot satisfactorily meet or cannot meet at all.

# >Why Do We Need Something Beyond 4G?

Let's look at some of the familiar examples of applications and use cases we see all around us today. Once again reminder, that the fundamental question we are trying to ask and answer is do we truly need something beyond 4G or is 4G going to be sufficient? So what are some of the modern-day use cases? As we know, multimedia or entertainment have been digitized and are available on the go for pretty much everybody. People expect to be able to stream videos and audio songs no matter where they are. They may be at a train station, they may be in a shopping mall or they may be waiting for their dentist appointment. But they expect rich multimedia to be available to them seamlessly, no matter where they are. Not only that, which is, by the way, the downlink aspect of the things. Not only that users by themselves are creating more and more content, and that content is getting richer with every passing day. Imagine what kind of pictures you would upload years ago and compare that with the high definition pictures and other multimedia content that you regularly upload your social media or even for your work purposes. So the user generated content is not only growing in volume and variety, but it is also getting richer and richer, thus demanding not just downlink throughput, but significantly higher uplink throughput as well. We are at a point where people expect to be able to use their phones and devices in congested environments as well environments such as football stadiums, concert venues, enterprises, buildings where there may be not just one or two, but hundreds or even thousands of users trying to use their phones and devices at the same time. And that puts an unprecedentedly high load on cellular networks, something that we need to seriously ask whether legacy technologies can help support.

Given that work is becoming mobile and truly remote and people expect to be able to work from anywhere, no matter where they are. It is natural of some of them to expect to be able to work even when they are on for example, high speed train, even if they are moving at 100 or 200 miles an hour, they will expect for high speed broadband like connectivity to be available on their mobile devices, even though they are moving at high speed on themselves, and that puts yet another dimension of pressure on existing ecosystems. The flip side of remote or ubiquitous work is that people will expect to have access to cloud computing no matter where they are. Maybe they are waiting for their flight at an airport, or maybe they are sitting in the lobby of their office building. But as more and more work is moving to the cloud, you need a reliable and high speed, high bandwidth, low latency conduit between your device and the cloud infrastructure, on which your device stores and retrieves all the data

from. So the expectation that people will be able to work from anywhere is underscored in the fact that connected cloud computing is taking up more and more amount of wireless resources these days. Not to mention that immersive rich experiences like virtual reality or augmented reality requires significant data rates themselves. But not only that, along with the data rate, they also need extremely low latency and extremely high reliability because even one or two data packets in the virtual reality stream getting lost could be the difference between superb user experience and mediocre user experience.

And finally, we all see the advent of connected vehicles all around us. Vehicles are significantly smarter and more autonomous today than they were just ten years ago, let alone 15 or 20 years ago. And not only does the connected vehicle entail that you will be able to stream a movie for entertainment purposes, but it also entails that the vehicle, which is getting more and more software oriented, will be able to download software updates on the go map updates, for example, for navigation purposes. But not only that, more importantly, as vehicles become more autonomous, they will be able to communicate with other vehicles in their vicinity. And that communication, because it is so time critical, will require the underlying networks to provide a communication on a millisecond or even a microsecond basis. And the question that we need to ask ourselves is; given that all these up and coming applications impose some of the strictest requirements on the underlying networks,
Play video starting at :5:6 and follow transcript5:06
how can we summarize those into a few points of a mission statement, so to speak, that will be applicable for the next technology should we determine it is indeed necessary? So some of the requirements could be distilled into these points here in that the up and coming applications of today and tomorrow require ultra high speeds and ultra high network capacity. Not only that, many of them will absolutely require low lag or low time delay so that they can offer real-time and interactive experience to their users, like VR or augmented reality. Furthermore, it wouldn't be very difficult, for example, to invent a different technology and build different networks for each of these individualized purposes. But the true power of this or any other technology would be to be able to serve all of these use cases and applications under the umbrella of just one common network or one common framework. And the broader mission statement for any technology of the future would be to not just connect individual people, but connect everyone and everything, i.e. not just connect all the people to each other, but connect all their devices that they use to other devices as well. And as it turns out, none of the legacy technologies, be it LTE or be it Wi-Fi, were designed to keep all these stringent requirements in mind. They weren't designed to meet the stringent requirements of these up and coming use cases. And that tells us that in order to not just meet, but significantly exceed the expectations of these cutting edge up and coming applications of today, tomorrow and beyond, we need a technology that goes beyond 4G or Wi-Fi. And that is the advent and justification for the next generation of cellular technology that is 5G, which is the technology that is going to be truly essential for next generation mobile experiences. And now that we have seen why we need a new technology beyond 4G. Let's look at some of the high level technological promises that this new technology 5G makes

# >5G NR: New Levels of Capability and Efficiency

So 5G also known as NR or new radio, the acronyms are interchangeable. So 5G NR is expected to provide us with unprecedented levels of capability and efficiency. The improvements that 5G promises to make on top of legacy technologies aren't linear but they are on the orders of magnitude in that. Those improvements aren't just like 10% or 20% better than before, but they are seriously 10 x or 50 x or 100 times better than what existed before. Now what are some of the broader dimensions of improvement that 5G can offer us? What are some of the headlines on which 5G makes such orders of magnitude improvement. Those are listed over here in sequence. First of all goes without saying that 5G will offer us significantly higher speeds or data rates also known as throughput as we know by now. 5G will offer a significantly higher data rates than existing technologies. And in that sense, those speeds are comparable to what we can get on a wired fiber connection or sometimes even beyond those fiber like speeds. So that would entail multi gigabits per second peak rates for download which is consumption and upload which is sharing data on the uplink. So fiber-like speeds which are an order of magnitude higher than existing technologies is the first USP of this up and coming technology that is 5G. Another way to look at it is that of latency, latency is a technical name for packet delay, meaning that if you try to send one data packet from the transmitter to the receiver or any point in between. What is the time that it takes for the packet to go from point A to point B. That time delay in technical parlance is known as latency. And 5G's target is to significantly reduce the latency that it takes for the packet to go from one point to another. One of the headline offering is that 5G can help support end to end latency is that are as low as one milliseconds which is 1000 of one second significantly lower than the blink of a human eye. And if you have prior background on let's say AT or WiFi you will know that. Those technologies clearly weren't designed to reliably provide such low end to end latency is for example like one millisecond. But hold on you might ask do we really need one millisecond like delays? Well they may not be needed for 100% of the applications but there are certain prominent applications or use cases wearing those millisecond level delays would be absolutely essential. Think of all the interactive real time applications such as not just entertainment oriented applications like virtual or augmented reality but think about mission critical communication. Think about remote robotic surgery. Every millisecond in such crucial scenarios is going to count and it will be beneficial for any network to significantly and materially reduce the buffering and lag. That the data packets suffer in the underlying network in order to clearly meet the stringent requirements of such applications of tomorrow. And that is where the promise of low latency, as low as one millisecond becomes really helpful. Now fiber-like speeds and extremely low latency would be very cool to have. But how many people can we provide such unprecedented performance? Can we provide such performance to just top 10% of the users or can we provide such level of experience to nearly every user in the network? Well 5G has some features that will get into later that allow us to not just provide this unprecedented level of performance to some users, but to the extent possible, uniformly over the entire network. So reliability of performance, not just the peak level of performance Is of interest in the fundamental 5G design as well. For example, even if you are located in extremely challenging cell coverage conditions, near a proverbial coverage hole, so to speak. 5G if deployed correctly can give you more than 100 Mbps throughput, for example, even in such challenging conditions. Whereas in some of the legacy technologies were spotted out at a few 100 k bps or just one or two mbps at best. So 5G is not only going to give you breathtakingly high peak performance but it is also going to spread the wealth, so to speak. And going to assure if deployed correctly, assure that a big performance to a broader sliver of the population, much better than what legacy technologies could look. And while doing all that 5G is also going to be economically beneficial for network operators that deployed. Because on account of some of the fundamental network architecture changes that 5G has made, which we'll talk about in some of the later models today. The cost to provision one bit from one point to another, that cost is reducing with every passing generation of cellular communication. And 5G continues with the same trend and it offers a lower cost-per-bit as compared to any of the legacy technologies. That will help network operators offer high limit or essentially no limit, unlimited data plans to more and more consumers at more and more affordable prices. So these are some of the headline improvements that 5G makes with respect to speed, latency, reliability and uniformity of performance and the cost-per-bit that is relevant to network operators. And if you have to put a number on our claim, some of the initial requirements that have been put forth for 5G include a 10x expectation of throughput improvement. About 10x expectation in the reduction of end to end latency, meaning that if your latency earlier was ten seconds for example, 5G is expected to cut that by a factor of 10 to one second.. Not just that connection density is also expected to go up given that we won't just utilize phones to communicate with the network. But all the devices that exist around us will also try to communicate with the 5G network. The density of devices that are trying to connect to the network in a given area that is also going to significantly increase on the order of 10x as compared to what it does today. Spectral efficiency also needs to improve and the initial target is a threefold improvement and efficiency with which those devices will be able to utilize their frequency spectrum. And with all these improvements in place, 5G will be able to offer 100x improvement in the total traffic volume that the networks can handle. So these are some of the improvements that 5G promises to make and these are the orders of magnitude by which 5G will try to improve things on top of the Legacy Technologies.

# >5G NR Service Classes Overview

Now one might ask, hey, this 10x, improvement in through ports 10x reduction in latency. Would we need those improvements for all the applications or would there be some form of pick and choose arrangement? Well, the answer is the latter and that is what brings us to discuss the service classes that 5G offers. What is a service class? Well, it is a broad umbrella of services and all the applications or use cases that underlie the umbrella, happen to share some of the common requirements or characteristics. So consider service classes as umbrellas of applications or use cases, each of which shares some commonalities with other applications under the same umbrella. There are three main service classes in 5G. First up is eMBB or enhanced mobile broadband. It is essentially further high speed internet. The second one is mMTC or massive machine type communications, also known as mIoT or massive IOT. And the third one is URLLC, ultra reliable, low latency communications. And now that we have seen, what are some of the high level promises that 5G makes, what kind of improvements people are expecting from 5G and what kind of service classes 5G is going to offer. Let's now try to dig in a little deeper into each of those service classes and try to put all the fundamentals we have learned so far together by learning a little bit more detail about each of those service classes.

# >Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)

Let's look at the first service class we talked about, that is eMBB. I like to emphasize that eMBB at such or any other service class titles aren't applications by themselves, they are rather service classes in that they are the umbrella under which specific applications can reside, applications that share certain common traits among them. What is the fundamental tenet of eMBB, which stands for enhanced mobile broadband? As the name suggests, eMBB is further high-speed Internet, speeds that are tenfold higher than those offered by the legacy technologies. As it says here, emphasis of eMBB clearly is on higher speeds and spectral efficiency because as we know, higher spectral efficiency contributes ultimately to higher speeds. What kind of applications would require eMBB, i.e. what kind of applications might fall under the umbrella of eMBB service class? Imagine pretty much any application that requires high throughput. Applications like Cloud computing, real-time video streaming, or real-time multiplayer gaming, or HD telephoning, whatever applications require significantly higher throughput or data rate. Those are the prime candidates for eMBB and that's why the emphasis is on improving speeds and spectral efficiency. On the other hand, some of the resource-oriented metrics such as bandwidth and power usage take a backseat. Not that bandwidth and power usage are completely ignored in here maybe no, they are optimized to a certain extent as well. But the priority emphasis is on maximizing data speeds and spectral efficiency even if it means that you consume a little more bandwidth and a little more power than you would otherwise. That is okay as long as those modifications help you meet the multi-gigabits per second requirements of these modern day applications. What are some of the sample bitrates that eMBB service class could provide us? Well, if an application requires peak user data rate of more than 10 gigabits per second, that is an eMBB candidate. If you aggregate all the devices in the network or in a given geographical area, the network throughput of such an eMBB specific deployment would easily exceed one terabits per second. So both of these numbers are an order of magnitude higher than what legacy technologies are capable of offering us. Now, all these applications that I mentioned earlier with their disparate bandwidth requirements can be deployed in a variety of networking scenarios. For example, if you have networking background, you will know that in cellular networks, there are two types of cells, macro and small cells. But even if you don't know those, let's quickly understand what those are. The cell towers that we see all around us on tops of buildings or on facades of buildings, they are the proverbial macrocells or macro base stations because they cover an area that is few square kilometers or such. So the radius of the cell would be equivalent of a few hundred meters or even more than a kilometer. Because they cover the network on a broader or a macro basis, they are called macrocells whereas small cells, as the name suggests, are responsible for covering only a small subset of the network area. For example, consider a football stadium or consider a shopping mall. Both of those will be significantly smaller than the zip code or a block of a city, let alone an entire city by itself, and that's why you may not need the full-fledged or macro base station set up in order to cover those locations in a focused manner. You can cover those using a miniature version of a macro base station, and that is called a small cell and eMBB has been designed to be able to seamlessly operate in macro as well as small cell scenarios. Furthermore, eMBB is also designed to support such high data rates or equivalent even if the user is moving at high speeds. We earlier saw a prominent use case of remote work in that even if somebody is on a high-speed train that is moving at 100 or 200 miles an hour, they will expect high-speed broadband-like Internet to be available to them and eMBB is in a position to provide exactly that.

# >Massive Machine-Type Communications (m-MTC)

The next service class is that of MMTC or massive machine type communications. Also alternatively known as mIoT or massive IOT. And if you eyeball this name for a minute, massive machine type communications, you might get a sense of what it means and you will be right in most cases in that. This particular service class is meant for devices or applications that are mostly unmanned. For example, our phones or tablets are devices that we closely interact with on a daily basis. Whereas there are many other types of devices that will also benefit from network connectivity devices that human beings either don't directly interact with or interact with on a very infrequent basis. Imagine for example, your utility meter, your kitchen appliances. You certainly don't use your utility meter as often as you use your phone or tablet. Extending that use case further, imagine all the peripheral devices that exist around us. For example, our fitness tracker, smart home devices, garage door openers and apart from that many other industrial devices such as sensors, industrial camera, industrial robotic vehicles, etc. All those devices which otherwise wouldn't connect to a network under the umbrella of mMTC, those devices will now also be provided with reliable network connectivity regardless of where they are, whether they are in the home or whether they are in an industry. So the basic tenet of mMTC is to connect not just people but they're worlds in that connect not just their phones and tablets, but also connect with each other. The devices that as human beings are surrounded by on a daily basis. Even if we may not be aware of the existence of the device. mMTC is the umbrella that enables such electronic devices to communicate with the network and enter with each other. And because we are going to connect under this umbrella, many many more devices of different types than we did before. Stands to reason that the expected device density for mMTC will be significantly higher than that for EMB for example, because you might have just a few 100 phones in a given square mile or square kilometer. But imagine how many fitness trackers you would have, how many utility meters, how many kitchen appliances, how many smart home devices you will have in a given squared kilometer or a square mile. And if you do the math, even the most conservative number comes to more than a few 100,000 devices, per squared kilometer. Reasonably capped at about one million devices per squared kilometer. And the synonym that I mentioned for mMTC massive IOT, that is where it comes from. I hope all of you know what IOT internet of things that is essentially your devices communicating with each other. And once you scale that paradigm on a massive stage like one million devices in a given area, that is what leads us to the paradigm of massive IOT also known as mMTC, or massive machine type communication.
Play video starting at :3:35 and follow transcript3:35
Now, the fact that those million devices could be located anywhere and not just in our hands, tells us that at least some of those devices may be located far away from the nearest base station. Or they may be located in challenging coverage conditions. For example, look at your utility meter, that utility meter is likely going to be in a narrow alleyway between two houses. Or imagine fire sensor that has deployed somewhere deep inside a forest in order to detect and alert us about any wildfires. You cannot reasonably expect that those devices can have really pristine channel conditions simply because of the operating conditions that they're deployed in. The corollary of that fact is that nor can you expect anybody to go to the forest every week and recharge or change the batteries on the fire sensor that you have dropped in there. And that would indicate that that fire sensor would have to operate on the same battery supply for days or weeks or months or even years on it. And that requires us to fundamentally rethink our protocol design to make those protocols more power conservative rather than aggressive in terms of data transmissions. And that plays out well because most of these mMTC devices won't have significant data requirements. Imagine your utility meter, once again, what kind of data it would need to transmit just like what my IOT is, what time of the day it is and what is my current electrical readings? That data doesn't require more than a few mbps of throughput. However, it does require a reliable connection, no matter how challenging the coverage conditions get. And that is the reason why the fundamental emphasis of mMTC is on power conservation and simplicity of protocols instead of spirit or spectral efficiency. And given that protocols have been simplified, the mMTC devices in general tend to be very simple and low cost as compared to the devices we are used to visualizing for eMBB, such as phones or tablets.

# >Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC)

Now that we have seen what mMBB and mMTC are, let's take a quick look at what URLLC is. URLLC is an umbrella that encompasses all the applications and use cases that require a highly reliable but at the same time low latency communication link. What kind of use cases would require such an arrangement will think about mission critical communications. Military, first responders, law enforcement for all of those use cases every second counts, not just that even a fraction of a second could be a difference between a desired outcome and an undesired outcome. And for those use cases that are termed mission critical in industry parlance, we are definitely going to need ultra reliable, low latency communications. But there is an application of URLLC beyond mission critical services as well. In general, wherever low latency and high reliability would significantly improve the user experience or the safety of the user, that is where you are sick and potentially be deployed. Imagine once again use cases such as remote healthcare, remote or robotic surgery, secure financials, real time manufacturing where in every second or potentially every millisecond could count and being able to optimize the performance at that level could bring us substantial benefits. Those are also the areas where URLLC is a prime candidate. So what are some of the fundamental promises of URLLC? Well, as the name suggests, emphasis is on minimizing end to end latency instead of emphasizing higher speeds. Now, if some of the algorithms that minimize latency also happened to increase speed well and good, but the point is speed is not the first priority for some of these use cases. Minimizing latency is priority number one. And an equally important priority as latency is improving reliability and availability. Reliability should be easier to understand, how reliable your system is. If you send a data packet across what is the likelihood that the data packet will reach the other end and still be equitable to that essentially is reliability. Availability is how often your system will be available when you really want to use it. For example sometimes it happens that you open the web app on your phone and you try to load a webpage but it doesn't load on the first attempt, you have to refresh it once and then that web page loads on the second attempt. It sometimes happens. That essentially is one way to understand availability, because availability of the system was low, your webpage did not lower on the first attempt and you needed one more attempt. But think about it you cannot expect mission critical officers such as law enforcement representative or a military soldier to keep loading the pages while they are in the battlefield or in the city streets. And that's where the crucial promise of availability comes into picture. As far as both reliability and availability are concerned, 5G URLLC is in a position to offer extremely reliable and available performance on the order of five nines or six nines as the example shows here. Now once again not every application will require the identical degree of latency, reliability and availability, all we are saying here is that 5G URLLC is a position to offer such improvements should your application need those improvements. And another corollary of URLLC is that given that the candidates for such service would be mobile in most cases. Once again think about first responders or law enforcement officers, you cannot expect them to be chained to a desk, they will be moving as a part of their job. And your networking system needs to be robust and resilient enough in order to provide such superior experience, not just when your target is steady but even when your target is moving in high speeds. And that goes without saying also requires fundamental redesign of some of the legacy protocols. And in fact in some of the latter modules we will see how 5G has made some of the substantial improvements that help 5G promise not just significantly higher data rates and network capacity as required for mMBB, but also offer significantly higher connection density as required by mMTC. And at the same time offer significantly lower latency and significantly higher reliability than before as may be required for URLLC.
