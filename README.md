# 5G-FOR-EVERYONE
In this we discuss 8 modules about 5G .
## 1 MODULE: wireless communications and cellular networks
# first we will understand what factors ultimately impact the speed of the data rate that you get on your phone. Now, wireless communication allows transfer of information between a transmitter and a receiver without a physical medium. Emphasis on that clause, "without a physical medium." That is because many other forms of communications that we engage in on a daily basis require some or the other form of a medium. For example, a landline phone, if you have one at home, the signal for the landline phone comes over a wire, hence the name landline. Even our modern-day internet connection is actually delivered to your home using some form of an internet cable. Even when we speak with each other, our voice requires an explicit medium such as air or other solid medium to go from one point to another. In contrast to all of those examples, wireless communication does not need a physical medium. It can travel just as well in a vacuum space, so to speak. 

# a typical wireless communication system has four fundamental components; A transmitter, a receiver, a wireless signal, and a fourth imaginary entity that is called a wireless channel.What is a transmitter?The entity that is looking to transmit some data to the other end over a wireless medium, that will be called the transmitter. On the other hand, the entity that is looking to receive that data will be called the receiver. In modern-day communication systems, most devices have the capability to act as both the transmitter as well as the receiver, either at the same time or at different points in time. As we all know, our antennas are also an integral part of any transmitter or receiver, because that is what helps you send or receive wireless signals. That brings us to the other two entities in a typical wireless system namely wireless signals are also called radio-frequency signals or RF Signals, and the imaginary channel over which those wireless signals go from one point to another called either the wireless channel or the radio channel.
